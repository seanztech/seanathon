        This is one of my favorite books of all time. Flowers for Algernon is a poignant and interesting tale about a man with learning disabilities who has a diminished mental capacity who undergoes an experimental operation the first of it kind which transforms him over time to be a genius. The book is brilliant because it is written from the point of view of Charlie who writes childishly at first, at times even hard to read, but you slowly see his capacity for language develop until the point where it is hard to read but only because it is so advanced. In Charlie's logs about his experience throughout this experiment he begins to be conscious of things he was unaware of before and you see him struggle with life and relationships the more his mind develops.

        To me, his insights and emotions are at times very relatable and this is why I think I like this book so much. I give this book a 10/10 as it is one of the few books I just couldn't put down at times. If you're looking for a very introspective book with an interesting concept and a little bit of a twist I completely recommend this read. It will have you questioning what it means to live a fulfilling life and you will fall for Charlie as he goes from limited mental capabilities to exceptionally smart. But while he becomes very smart, it doesn't mean he is wise.
