    <p>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another one of my all time favorite books as it centers around Charlie, an introverted high-schooler who decides to write about his freshman year of high-school. The book revolves around Charlie meeting Sam and Patrick, two seniors who befriend Charlie and bring him into their friend group. I love this book so much because Charlie's inner dialogue is very sweet and at times relatable as he develops feelings for his new friends and tries to navigate social situations which he is not at all adept at doing. If you're an introvert this book was basically made for you and you'll probably find it amusing but be warned there is some serious trauma that gets uncovered about a few of the characters and it is not a light read at all times. 10/10 love it. </p>
