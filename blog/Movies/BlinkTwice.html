    <h1>Blink Twice Review</h1>
    <h4>5/17/2025</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>*SPOLIERS* Blink Twice is a thriller about what happens when you trust a billionaire. Basically Channing Tatum plays a billionaire who asks Naomi Ackie's character on a one in a lifetime trip to his tropical vacation island. Obviously she accepts and away we go! Things start off pretty lit as the daily activities are lounging in the pool, sunbathing, eating gourmet food, partying, and doing drugs. Pretty soon a bad feeling looms over Ackie's best friend in the film and things take a really dark turn. I think Naomi Ackie and the actress who played the 'Hot Survivor Babes' contestant had a really great performance as you see their joy turn into extreme fear. Naomi Ackie especially does a really great job of subtly displaying the character's inner fear in a situation where she must stay calm and keep a happy outer persona. This movie is very much carried by Ackie's performance however. It was very fun watching the women beat the shit out of the men in the ending. Naomi Ackie is a fantastic actress and I hope to see her in more films but parts of this movie did feel generic, but I still feel like it is worth a watch if you're in the mood for a thriller. 6/10</p>
