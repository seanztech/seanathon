    <h1>Fantastic Mr. Fox Review</h1>
    <h4>5/17/2025</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Fantastic Mr. Fox is a heist-adventure movie revolving around a family of foxes who dare to steal from three super farms in their neck of the woods. With a star studded cast and beautiful visuals typical of Wes Anderson movies, this heart warming story about looking past each others differences and coming together in times of crisis is great for a movie night. The film is also very witty and made me laugh more than once. All the voice actors do a fantastic job and the world building creates a charming and immersive experience that reflects upon aspects of human life and it is sure to create a lasting impression. 10/10 it is great. Definitely worth a watch or a rewatch if you haven't seen it in years like me. </p>
