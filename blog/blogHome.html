    <h1>About the Author:</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Sean Zalewski is a very handsome guy (winner of the Very Handsome Guy Award 2020) who likes to spend his time reading books about astrophysics and neurobiology , gaming, and occasionally saving cats from trees and helping grandmas cross the street on a busy intersection where nobody goes the speed limit and the local police response time is 5 days. He is considered a master of the Picard Maneuver and is one of the earliest adopters of wearing socks with crocs.</p>
        <p>When he is not writing his own biography for his blog he is catching large fish, creating prosthetic limbs for those animals you see on sad animal commercials that are like 10 minutes long for no reason, and learning about tech. His work in the retail space has reverberated all across the world and his degree in cybersecurity has certified him as an expert of doing a quick scan with Windows Defender, freaking out for 5 minutes when it finds a medium level vulnerability, and clicking the "Remediate" button.</p>
